# ft_printf

>This project is pretty straight forward. You will recode printf. You will then be allowed to reuse the function in your future projects. You will mainly learn how to use variadic arguments.

The goal of this project was to rewrite the standard C function printf, which has a prototype of int printf(const char *, ...) and can be used to print different variables to standard out.
